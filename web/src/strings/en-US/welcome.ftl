  # Welcome, {$pilot}.

  Thank you for checking out my game. While it's not much of a "game" yet, I have goals to build a community-driven game set in a [science-fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fantasy) universe.

  ### How to navigate

  ##### Mouse

  - **Left mouse button**:
    - Click and drag will drag the map around
    - Double-click will set your ship's destination
  - **Scroll Wheel**:
    - Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and zoom out. It will zoom centered around your cursor.

  ##### Touch Screen

  - **One finger**:
    - Touch and drag will drag the map around
    - Double-tap will set your ship's destination
  - **Two fingers**:
    - Pinch two fingers together or push them apart to zoom in or out on the map
